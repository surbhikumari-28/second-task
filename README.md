This project is a simple To-Do App created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter tasks, add them to the list, and remove them when they are done. The main goal of this project was to practice working with JavaScript for handling user input, dynamically updating the task list, and improving my understanding of basic web development concepts. The design is clean and easy to use, making it a beginner-friendly project.
